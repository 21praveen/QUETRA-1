Files/Folders and their operations :

/script/script.sh 	: 	Preprocess all the log files in the current directory and call zqoe.sh and t.r
/script/zqoe.sh 	: 	Take the prepocessed from script.sh and put the extracted data in /script/RESULT/result.log. Please adjust max buufer parameter "Bf" for calculation of overflow.
/script/t.sh 	: 	Dreaws buffer occupancy and Throughput, bitrate varaiation graph fro all the log files in current director. The output graphs are created in /script/graph/ directory
/script/experimental log files : Raw log files for all buufer conditions 	:	30/60, 120 and 240 second. The file are named like : profile-sample-algorith. Eg. p1-t1-quetra
/script/experimental log files/<Buffer Capacity> / quetra vs others 	:	 Raw log files of quetra_lastTh and and existing algorithms (bba,bola,elastic,abr)
/script/experimental log files/<Buffer Capacity> /quetra versions 	:	 Raw log files of quetra (with different smoothing algorithms)
/script/experimental log files/<Buffer Capacity> /merged 	: 	Raw log files of all version of quetra (with different smoothing algorithms) and existing algorithms (bba,bola,elastic,abr)      
/script/Already extracted results from logs 	:	Contains log result for for different buffer conditions (30/60,120 and 240). Log result are of 3 types (with headder , without headder, headder in csv formate). Each log have following data - profile sample method bitrate change ineff stall numStall avgStall overflow numOverflow. The folder also consist of following R script files :
   /script/Already extracted results from logs/scriptForResultModification.sh		: 	Take log files name as input. It transform the log created by /script/RESULT/result.log into text log file with headders for Rscript. The log file thus obtained can be transformed into headder less and csv formate. 
   /script/Already extracted results from logs/xyPlot.r		:	Genrates xyplot out of csv log file. Takes x_parameeter, y_parameter and csv filename as input. Filter the methods by editing the file
   /script/Already extracted results from logs/sampleXYPlot.r	:	Genrates xyplot for a sample out of csv log file. Takes x_parameeter, y_parameter and csv filename as input. Change the Sample name and output file name inside the file. Filter the methods by editing the file

/script/Already extracted results from logs/bar.r		:	Takes paramter and csv log filename as input. Generates Avergae bar graph for the parameter across all saples and network profile. Filter the methods by editing the file.

/script/Already extracted results from logs/evaluate-avg.r 		: Takes csv log file as input. Generates bar graph for all parameters for all saples and network profile.

/script/Already extracted results from logs/evaluate-avgm.r 	:	Dummy. For personal reference.
/script/Already extracted results from logs/evaluate-avgp.r    :	Dummy. For personal reference.
/script/Already extracted results from logs/parameter.r 	: 	Doesn't take input. Headerless log file are hardcoded input. Generate bargraph for 3 buffer conditions for a parameter averaged across all saples and network profile. Parameter can be modified by modfying the the column number anf ylable inside file.
